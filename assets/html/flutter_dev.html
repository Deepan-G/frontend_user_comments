    Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit created by Google. It allows developers to build beautiful, natively
    compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Using Dart, Flutter provides
    reactive programming, pre-designed widgets, fast rendering, and hot reload for rapid development.
    Developers can create highly responsive apps with rich UI and smooth animations efficiently. Flutter
    is popular for cross-platform app development in both startups and enterprises.
